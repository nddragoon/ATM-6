All The Mods 6: Community Edition
======
This is an unofficial fork of the ATM6 pack by former contributors, striving to be more open and transparent to its community, and hopefully a more fun experience overall.

Does "All The Mods" *really* contain ALL THE MODS? No, of course not.

[Looking for the official pack?](https://github.com/AllTheMods/ATM-6)
